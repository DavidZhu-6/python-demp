                                                           Citizens in the Netherlands are ill prepared for a cyber attack or other type of disaster which might paralyse the country, experts have said ahead of a national awareness campaign starting on Thursday. Society needs to become more ‘resilient’ and people need to be capable of coping for at least 48 hours in case of a disaster, national terrorism prevention and safety coordinator Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg told the Parool. ‘I remember the then minister Guusje ter Horst’s 2009 campaign for an emergency pack for every home, with a battery powered radio, candles and a first aid kit. That awareness needs to come back,’ he said. Aalbersberg said the need to prepare is more urgent than ever because cyber attacks are increasing. The Netherlands is extra vulnerable because of its advanced digital technology and lack of analogue alternatives, he said. The government is not going to distribute emergency packs, justice minister Eric van der Burg told the paper, but there will be a dedicated website from Thursday. The website Denkvooruit.nl (think ahead) will include tips like like ‘stocking up on candles, batteries for your torch or a dynamo-powered torch which will always work in case of outages,’ Van der Burg said.  \n","1    An exhibition at The Hague’s Historisch Museum focuses on one of the most turbulent events in Dutch history and includes propaganda and a preserved human tongue among its highlights.  The ‘disaster year’ of 1672 is best known for the rapid and brutal downfall of the De Witt brothers, who had governed the United Provinces of the Netherlands for the best part of two decades. At the start of the year Johan de Witt was the most powerful man in the Republic. As Grand Pensionary of the state of Holland he had ended one war with England, triumphed in another and turned the Netherlands into the most formidable naval power in Europe. In March war again broke out with England, but this time the Dutch also faced invasion from France and two German bishoprics. The people grew restless and clamoured for De Witt’s rival, William of Orange, to be installed as kapitein-generaal, or head of the army. The net closed tightly on De Witt and his brother Cornelis, who was accused of plotting to kill William and taken to the Gevangenpoort prison in The Hague. When he refused to confess under torture, Johan was invited to fetch him from jail and take him into exile. But soon after he arrived a mob gathered outside the prison gates, dragged the brothers outside, lynched them from the public gallows and cut pieces from their corpses, either as souvenirs or as grisly snacks. None of the looters or the cannibals was ever caught. Exactly 350 years on from the rampjaar, an exhibition at The Hague’s Historic Museum focuses on its turbulent events and how public opinion turned so dramatically against the De Witts, with deadly consequences. Propaganda war ‘We have a lot of objects relating to the events of that year, like a preserved tongue and finger of the De Witt brothers, so it seemed like a good time to put them on display,’ says museum spokesman Martijn van Ooststroom. ‘But we didn’t just want to give a history lesson. We wanted it to appeal to a broader audience and link it to contemporary events like the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.’ The exhibition shows how propaganda sheets, a relatively recent invention – the first newspapers had appeared in Amsterdam in 1618 – played a key role in radicalising public opinion as the situation in the country deteriorated. Thousands of pamphlets were published during the year and distributed by hand, depicting the De Witt brothers as self-serving elitists who were out of touch or, worse, secretly in league with the United Provinces’ enemies. ‘Literacy was quite high in the Netherlands in the 17th century, so pamphlets had a real influence,’ says Van Ooststroom. ‘They’d been around for decades but this was a real explosion. ‘You can compare it to social media: these pamphlets were handed out in inns and other places, so a lot of people were able to read them. ‘They contained a lot of lies and false information: that Johan had sold the Netherlands to the king of France, or that he was secretly a papist, which was one of the worst things you could be in the Netherlands in the 17th century, or that the two brothers were devils. ‘At some point it started to stick, which is something we’ve seen recently as well.’ Orangists v regents The Netherlands in 1672 was polarised between the regents and merchants who supported De Witt, and the Orangist supporters of Prince William. Ultimately it was William who prevailed. He was elected as Stadholder, the dynastic position previously held by his father, in July, after harnessing the pamphleteers’ support. Shortly afterwards De Witt resigned from office as he recovered from a violent attack in the street. Suspicions are rife that William had a hand in the murderous campaign against the De Witt brothers in August. The mob outside the prison in The Hague emerged quickly while Johan was inside visiting his brother, after Cornelis’s newly released cellmate started spreading false rumours that he had been found guilty of treason. The fact that free beer was distributed among the crowd strengthens the view that the protest was not entirely spontaneous, but no evidence has been found that William was directly involved. William’s rise In 1654 De Witt had secretly signed an order as part of the peace treaty with England, then a republic ruled by Oliver Cromwell, that banned any member of the House of Orange from holding the office of Stadholder again. But after the restoration of the English monarchy, the Dutch authorities ruled that the Act of Seclusion, as it was known, was no longer valid. William thus had a vested interest in overthrowing De Witt’s government, and saw his chance when England and France joined forces to invade the Dutch republic, under a secret treaty agreed in 1670. ‘He was very much an opportunist,’ says Van Ooststroom. ‘People were tired of De Witt, who had been in power for almost 20 years and was seen as out of touch with the common people. ‘He ignored the growing resentment for too long and didn’t respond until it was too late. By then public information and his regents had turned against him. He issued his own pamphlets, but they were very legalistic and didn’t come across well.’ ‘At the same time the Netherlands was overrun because it didn’t put up a proper defence. He dismissed the idea that the two kings would work together against the Dutch republic and that meant he didn’t have time to reorganise his army.’ Pandemic parallels The parallels with the present day are explored in a second room, which compares the unravelling crisis of 1672 with the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. Early attempts to prevent the crisis inspired a mood of solidarity, but as events unravelled it gave rise to divisions, plummeting trust in leaders and a search for scapegoats – not unlike the reactions to the lockdowns of the last two years. An innovative sideline is a series of Twitter accounts set up in the name of Johan de Witt and others in his circle to promote the exhibition. The tweets are based on extracts from De Witt’s letters and diaries, complete with snarky replies from fictional pamphleteers. ‘We started the Twitter accounts before the exhibition to draw attention to it, but also so we could use the information from his letters to his friends, his family, officials and diplomats,’ says Van Ooststroom. ‘We have a huge amount of his correspondence: he wrote several letters a day. We know what his feelings were, which enables us to follow the development of the rampjaar day to day through his eyes.’ The Disaster Year exhibition is on show at The Hague Historic Museum until November 13  \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tuesday marks 30 years since the Bijlmermeer disaster, when an El Al cargo plane crashed into a block of flats in an area of social housing southeast of Amsterdam,  killing at least 43 people. At the time, the Bijlmermeer was viewed by many as a ‘no go area’ and its problems of social deprivation and crime were largely ignored. The real death toll itself remains open to question because the area was lived in by a large number of undocumented migrants. Yet even though crash and its aftermath focused both political and media attention on the district, leading to its ongoing rejuvenation, the scars still run deep. Ghanese born Mama Betty told the NRC she was drinking with friends when they heard a loud boom. ‘The gallery was full of people screaming and running for the stairs,’ she said. ‘You heard every language mixed up together: Dutch, Papiamento, Sranang, Ghanese.’ The plane had crashed less than 100 metres from her front door. Betty says she stood and watched as people escaped from the burning building. ‘People were throwing their children into the little canal next to it because that was the only way to get out,’ she said.  Several events and exhibitions have been organized to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster, including a five part television series about the crash and the aftermath, including speculation about the cargo and mysterious men in white suits. Special exhibitions have been curated at the Amsterdam Museum and Imagine IC in Zuidoost, in which the memories and experiences of people who lived through the crash are central. Broadcaster Omroep Zwart has produced a television documentary Een gat in mijn heart (a hole in my heart) which looks at the experiences of 30 children who were caught up in disaster.  Emergency landing The crash took place early on Sunday evening, October 4, 1992. The plane, with a crew of three and one passenger, had requested to make an emergency landing after two of its engines broke off and a wing was damaged shortly after take-off. It circled over Amsterdam to reduce altitude but the crew lost control of the aircraft and it hit the high rise complex, exploding into a fireball. The flats were demolished and a memorial near the crash site lists the names of the victims, close to a tree that survived the disaster, which is known as ‘the tree that saw it all’ (de boom die alles zag). Every year, a public memorial is held to mark the disaster and no planes fly over the area for one hour out of respect for the victims. ‘When October 4 approaches, I pray for the families of those who were affected,’ Betty said. ‘And I think of my neighbour who lost her three children. One of her daughters borrowed sunflower oil from me that afternoon. It was the last time I saw her.’ Tuesday evening’s remembrance ceremony will be broadcast live on NOS television.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Eleven aid agencies have opened up the collective appeal Giro555 to raise funds for what they have described as a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine. The charities are also broadcasting TV and radio commercials to bring in donations to Giro555. An earlier appeal, Giro5125, launched by the Red Cross last week, has raised €3.7 mn since the war started a week ago. ‘People need direct emergency aid such as housing, medical care and clean drinking water, said Giro555 appeal chairman Kees Zevenbergen. ‘For millions of Ukrainians, including 7.5 million children, there are no certainties anymore. They are dependent on humanitarian aid and need our support.’ The organisations taking part include Stichting Vluchteling, CARE Nederland, Oxfam Novib, Save the Children, the Dutch Red Cross, UNICEF and Christian charity Kerk in Actie. Elsewhere in the Netherlands local organisations have been collecting essential supplies to send to Ukraine. An appeal to buy food parcels for Ukrainian truck drivers working in the Netherlands who are unable to access their bank accounts raised €125,000 in its first two days. In Leiden, marketing agency owner Roald Laport has been appealing for donations of blankets, toiletries and baby food, to be transported to the conflict zone via Limburg.  In Haarlem, vintage store owner Anna Roelofs-Ivanchenko is collecting clothes and other goods to be sent to the Polish and Romanian borders, where many women and children are taking shelter after the men were ordered to stay and fight. Enschede-based charity Twente voor Oekraine is taking donations and items including sleeping bags, mattresses, phone chargers and power banks to set up temporary shelters for refugees waiting to cross the border. Organiser Taco Potze, whose software firm Open Social employs 15 Ukrainian programmers, said he had had offers of support from several local businesses as well as football club FC Twente and the university. ‘The stories of these people and the images of their country on the news didn’t leave me unmoved,’ he told Tubantia. ‘I had to do something, I couldn’t ignore such a human tragedy.’  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Netherlands was not sufficiently prepared for a major infectious disease outbreak when the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Dutch safety board OVV said on Wednesday, in the first of three reports on the crisis. The subsequent focus on ‘combating an infectious disease’ meant that other interests – nursing homes, education, cultural institutions, and small and medium-sized businesses – were not taken into account when drawing up policy, the OVV said, in its 300 page publication. ‘The Covid-19 crisis touched people’s lives throughout the world. Here, the health crisis spilled over into the biggest social crisis we have seen in decades,’ OVV chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said. The first coronavirus case in the Netherlands was confirmed on February 27 and at that moment, there was a lack of expertise at a national level in dealing with an epidemic, which led to a lot of improvisation, the report said. In particular, the situation in nursing homes and in the community nursing sector were largely ignored, and this led to a ‘silent disaster’, the OVV said. Almost half the official coronavirus deaths in 2020 were among residential care residents. Warnings about the critical situation in nursing homes were often not heeded because the cabinet’s focus was on hospitals and intensive care ward capacity. Masks This meant, for example, that protective clothing such as face masks, was only available for hospitals and acute care services in the early stages, exposing nursing home residents and staff to considerable risk. ‘When the gravity of the situation in nursing homes became clear, the government issued a ban on visits at the request of the nursing home sector,’ the OVV said. ‘The social and psychological impact of this measure was keenly felt, leading to loneliness and in some cases denying family members the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones who lost their lives.’ The report also criticises the fragmented nature of the Dutch health service, which complicated communication and the way government experts appeared on television and interviews. ‘It was not always clear to outsiders whether the experts were responding in their talk show performance as members of the OMT, as independent consultants with specific expertise or as representatives of their own sectoral or professional association,’ the report said. ‘The fact that the chairman of the OMT (Jaap van Dissel) emphasised the political nature of the choice to make the wearing of face masks compulsory in public transport (in May 2020) and in public areas (in August 2020) while he himself openly expressed doubts as to the value of the measure, in no way helped maintain support for the announced measures.’  ‘As a result of these statements, government policy was effectively undermined by advisors to the same government.’ Tremendous efforts The report concludes that the pandemic was – and still is – a crisis of unprecedentedscale. ‘The tremendous efforts of many, which for those involved in the heart of the crisis organisation still continues to this day, has not been able to prevent the crisis eventually affecting everyone. People were not only hit by the crisis itself, but also by the implemented measures.’ In the future, officials should be ‘acutely aware of the needs of vulnerable groups and monitor the approach to make sure that it is working for them,’ the board said. There should also be a clear separation between the role of the advisors (the experts) and the role of the decision makers (the government officials). The report focuses on the period March to September 2020. The second report, which covers the period September 2020 to July 2021, will be published in the summer.  \n","..

freight which fell overboard from a container ship in the Wadden Sea during bad weather in January has still not been recovered, infrastructure minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen has told MPs. The MSC Zoe lost 342 containers of goods, leading to a massive clean-up operation as plastic, toys and machinery were washed up on the shores of the Wadden Islands. In total, 299 containers have been salvaged at a cost of €35m so far, with the ship’s owner picking up the bill. The minister said  further efforts to use boats and divers to recover the goods would be pointless because the items have been spread over such a large area. Each search costs 2.5 litres of diesel for every kilo of recovered waste, the minister said in her briefing. The MSC Zoe is one of the biggest freighters in the world and can carry 19,000 containers in total. It was heading from Portugal to Bremerhaven in Germany when the containers came loose in high seas. The beach clean-up operation will last until mid 2020 and beyond if necessary, the minister said. The coastline of the Wadden island of Schiermonnikoog, for example, remains polluted with plastic beading, and new waste continues to wash up every day.  \n","469

particularly at why Ukrainian air space had not been closed. During a debate on the tragedy, in which 298 people died, MPs called on Blok to find out why the Malaysia Airlines plane was able to fly over Ukraine even though there was serious fighting in the east. The Dutch safety board said in 2015 there had been enough reason to close airspace. The plane, carrying mainly Dutch nationals, was brought down by a Russian made Buk missile over eastern Ukraine in July 2014. According to the Parool, the government has been reluctant to ask Ukraine difficult questions because it is an ally and closely involved in the investigation into what happened. Unlike Russia, Ukraine is not being held partly responsible for the disaster. But the close relationship between Ukraine and the Netherlands has been soured since Kiev returned a possible witness to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange scheme.  \n","470

chairman of the Dutch Socialist Party has said he will stand down when his current term of office expires at the end of this year. Ron Meyer’s decision follows his party’s poor performance in three successive elections – the local elections last year and the provincial and European votes in 2019. In particular Meyer said he considered himself to be personally responsible for the ‘painful’ collapse of SP support in last week’s EU elections, which saw the party lose all its representation in Brussels. Parliamentary party leader Lilian Marijnissen, who described last week’s vote as an ‘enormous disappointment’, said she had no intention of resigning but admitted ‘mistakes were made in the campaign’.

on the soap opera that is Rotterdam’s campaign and explain how and where you can cast your vote. Elsewhere, was ING’s about-turn on its CEO’s pay rise a victory for people power, and did Unilever’s decision to close its London headquarters really have nothing to do with Brexit or the Dutch government’s abolition of dividend tax?

      Hundreds of thousands of people in their 50s who took out interest-only mortgages face major problems in getting a new mortgage because they have not paid off any of the principle debt, the AD said on Wednesday. Many people have a virtual hundreds of thousands of euros in equity tied up in their property because of rising prices, but that does not usually count towards a new mortgage, the paper said. Rather, mortgages are based on income and, for older people, future pension payments. A survey for ING by Kantar TNS found half of people in their 50s don’t see the need to save up and pay off the principal debt. Around half of them have not saved up any money to pay off their mortgage, the AD said. The Dutch central bank said earlier it estimated 200,000 people in their 50s could find themselves in financial trouble because of their interest-only mortgages, which enabled them to keep their monthly outgoings low. ‘Most home owners feel comfortable in their homes because they have built up a substantial increase in equity,’ ING mortgage expert Wim Flikweert said in the bank’s latest housing market briefing. ‘They’ve lived in their homes for a long time and their mortgage is relatively low. But it really is important that they have sufficient income at the point when their mortgage has to be extended.’  \n","\n","[473 rows x 4 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-45ee1592-955f-40a4-91f3-57c4dd20bbef\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Date</th>\n","      <th>Url</th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Content</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>November 30, 2022</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/11/ill-prepared-dutch-need-disaster-kit-at-the-ready-says-terrorism-expert/</td>\n","      <td>‘Ill prepared’ Dutch need disaster kit at the ready, says terrorism expert</td>\n","      <td>Citizens in the Netherlands are ill prepared for a cyber attack or other type of disaster which might paralyse the country, experts have said ahead of a national awareness campaign starting on Thursday. Society needs to become more ‘resilient’ and people need to be capable of coping for at least 48 hours in case of a disaster, national terrorism prevention and safety coordinator Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg told the Parool. ‘I remember the then minister Guusje ter Horst’s 2009 campaign for an emergency pack for every home, with a battery powered radio, candles and a first aid kit. That awareness needs to come back,’ he said. Aalbersberg said the need to prepare is more urgent than ever because cyber attacks are increasing. The Netherlands is extra vulnerable because of its advanced digital technology and lack of analogue alternatives, he said. The government is not going to distribute emergency packs, justice minister Eric van der Burg told the paper, but there will be a dedicated website from Thursday. The website Denkvooruit.nl (think ahead) will include tips like like ‘stocking up on candles, batteries for your torch or a dynamo-powered torch which will always work in case of outages,’ Van der Burg said.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>October 9, 2022</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/10/fake-news-cannibalism-and-a-human-tongue-the-disaster-year-of-1672/</td>\n","      <td>Fake news, cannibalism and a human tongue: the disaster year of 1672</td>\n","      <td>An exhibition at The Hague’s Historisch Museum focuses on one of the most turbulent events in Dutch history and includes propaganda and a preserved human tongue among its highlights.  The ‘disaster year’ of 1672 is best known for the rapid and brutal downfall of the De Witt brothers, who had governed the United Provinces of the Netherlands for the best part of two decades. At the start of the year Johan de Witt was the most powerful man in the Republic. As Grand Pensionary of the state of Holland he had ended one war with England, triumphed in another and turned the Netherlands into the most formidable naval power in Europe. In March war again broke out with England, but this time the Dutch also faced invasion from France and two German bishoprics. The people grew restless and clamoured for De Witt’s rival, William of Orange, to be installed as kapitein-generaal, or head of the army. The net closed tightly on De Witt and his brother Cornelis, who was accused of plotting to kill William and taken to the Gevangenpoort prison in The Hague. When he refused to confess under torture, Johan was invited to fetch him from jail and take him into exile. But soon after he arrived a mob gathered outside the prison gates, dragged the brothers outside, lynched them from the public gallows and cut pieces from their corpses, either as souvenirs or as grisly snacks. None of the looters or the cannibals was ever caught. Exactly 350 years on from the rampjaar, an exhibition at The Hague’s Historic Museum focuses on its turbulent events and how public opinion turned so dramatically against the De Witts, with deadly consequences. Propaganda war ‘We have a lot of objects relating to the events of that year, like a preserved tongue and finger of the De Witt brothers, so it seemed like a good time to put them on display,’ says museum spokesman Martijn van Ooststroom. ‘But we didn’t just want to give a history lesson. We wanted it to appeal to a broader audience and link it to contemporary events like the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.’ The exhibition shows how propaganda sheets, a relatively recent invention – the first newspapers had appeared in Amsterdam in 1618 – played a key role in radicalising public opinion as the situation in the country deteriorated. Thousands of pamphlets were published during the year and distributed by hand, depicting the De Witt brothers as self-serving elitists who were out of touch or, worse, secretly in league with the United Provinces’ enemies. ‘Literacy was quite high in the Netherlands in the 17th century, so pamphlets had a real influence,’ says Van Ooststroom. ‘They’d been around for decades but this was a real explosion. ‘You can compare it to social media: these pamphlets were handed out in inns and other places, so a lot of people were able to read them. ‘They contained a lot of lies and false information: that Johan had sold the Netherlands to the king of France, or that he was secretly a papist, which was one of the worst things you could be in the Netherlands in the 17th century, or that the two brothers were devils. ‘At some point it started to stick, which is something we’ve seen recently as well.’ Orangists v regents The Netherlands in 1672 was polarised between the regents and merchants who supported De Witt, and the Orangist supporters of Prince William. Ultimately it was William who prevailed. He was elected as Stadholder, the dynastic position previously held by his father, in July, after harnessing the pamphleteers’ support. Shortly afterwards De Witt resigned from office as he recovered from a violent attack in the street. Suspicions are rife that William had a hand in the murderous campaign against the De Witt brothers in August. The mob outside the prison in The Hague emerged quickly while Johan was inside visiting his brother, after Cornelis’s newly released cellmate started spreading false rumours that he had been found guilty of treason. The fact that free beer was distributed among the crowd strengthens the view that the protest was not entirely spontaneous, but no evidence has been found that William was directly involved. William’s rise In 1654 De Witt had secretly signed an order as part of the peace treaty with England, then a republic ruled by Oliver Cromwell, that banned any member of the House of Orange from holding the office of Stadholder again. But after the restoration of the English monarchy, the Dutch authorities ruled that the Act of Seclusion, as it was known, was no longer valid. William thus had a vested interest in overthrowing De Witt’s government, and saw his chance when England and France joined forces to invade the Dutch republic, under a secret treaty agreed in 1670. ‘He was very much an opportunist,’ says Van Ooststroom. ‘People were tired of De Witt, who had been in power for almost 20 years and was seen as out of touch with the common people. ‘He ignored the growing resentment for too long and didn’t respond until it was too late. By then public information and his regents had turned against him. He issued his own pamphlets, but they were very legalistic and didn’t come across well.’ ‘At the same time the Netherlands was overrun because it didn’t put up a proper defence. He dismissed the idea that the two kings would work together against the Dutch republic and that meant he didn’t have time to reorganise his army.’ Pandemic parallels The parallels with the present day are explored in a second room, which compares the unravelling crisis of 1672 with the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. Early attempts to prevent the crisis inspired a mood of solidarity, but as events unravelled it gave rise to divisions, plummeting trust in leaders and a search for scapegoats – not unlike the reactions to the lockdowns of the last two years. An innovative sideline is a series of Twitter accounts set up in the name of Johan de Witt and others in his circle to promote the exhibition. The tweets are based on extracts from De Witt’s letters and diaries, complete with snarky replies from fictional pamphleteers. ‘We started the Twitter accounts before the exhibition to draw attention to it, but also so we could use the information from his letters to his friends, his family, officials and diplomats,’ says Van Ooststroom. ‘We have a huge amount of his correspondence: he wrote several letters a day. We know what his feelings were, which enables us to follow the development of the rampjaar day to day through his eyes.’ The Disaster Year exhibition is on show at The Hague Historic Museum until November 13</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>October 4, 2022</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/10/film-documentary-and-exhibitions-mark-30-years-since-the-bijlmer-disaster/</td>\n","      <td>Film, documentary and exhibitions mark 30 years since the Bijlmer disaster</td>\n","      <td>Tuesday marks 30 years since the Bijlmermeer disaster, when an El Al cargo plane crashed into a block of flats in an area of social housing southeast of Amsterdam,  killing at least 43 people. At the time, the Bijlmermeer was viewed by many as a ‘no go area’ and its problems of social deprivation and crime were largely ignored. The real death toll itself remains open to question because the area was lived in by a large number of undocumented migrants. Yet even though crash and its aftermath focused both political and media attention on the district, leading to its ongoing rejuvenation, the scars still run deep. Ghanese born Mama Betty told the NRC she was drinking with friends when they heard a loud boom. ‘The gallery was full of people screaming and running for the stairs,’ she said. ‘You heard every language mixed up together: Dutch, Papiamento, Sranang, Ghanese.’ The plane had crashed less than 100 metres from her front door. Betty says she stood and watched as people escaped from the burning building. ‘People were throwing their children into the little canal next to it because that was the only way to get out,’ she said.  Several events and exhibitions have been organized to mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster, including a five part television series about the crash and the aftermath, including speculation about the cargo and mysterious men in white suits. Special exhibitions have been curated at the Amsterdam Museum and Imagine IC in Zuidoost, in which the memories and experiences of people who lived through the crash are central. Broadcaster Omroep Zwart has produced a television documentary Een gat in mijn heart (a hole in my heart) which looks at the experiences of 30 children who were caught up in disaster.  Emergency landing The crash took place early on Sunday evening, October 4, 1992. The plane, with a crew of three and one passenger, had requested to make an emergency landing after two of its engines broke off and a wing was damaged shortly after take-off. It circled over Amsterdam to reduce altitude but the crew lost control of the aircraft and it hit the high rise complex, exploding into a fireball. The flats were demolished and a memorial near the crash site lists the names of the victims, close to a tree that survived the disaster, which is known as ‘the tree that saw it all’ (de boom die alles zag). Every year, a public memorial is held to mark the disaster and no planes fly over the area for one hour out of respect for the victims. ‘When October 4 approaches, I pray for the families of those who were affected,’ Betty said. ‘And I think of my neighbour who lost her three children. One of her daughters borrowed sunflower oil from me that afternoon.

An earlier appeal, Giro5125, launched by the Red Cross last week, has raised €3.7 mn since the war started a week ago. ‘People need direct emergency aid such as housing, medical care and clean drinking water, said Giro555 appeal chairman Kees Zevenbergen. ‘For millions of Ukrainians, including 7.5 million children, there are no certainties anymore. They are dependent on humanitarian aid and need our support.’ The organisations taking part include Stichting Vluchteling, CARE Nederland, Oxfam Novib, Save the Children, the Dutch Red Cross, UNICEF and Christian charity Kerk in Actie. Elsewhere in the Netherlands local organisations have been collecting essential supplies to send to Ukraine. An appeal to buy food parcels for Ukrainian truck drivers working in the Netherlands who are unable to access their bank accounts raised €125,000 in its first two days. In Leiden, marketing agency owner Roald Laport has been appealing for donations of blankets, toiletries and baby food, to be transported to the conflict zone via Limburg.  In Haarlem, vintage store owner Anna Roelofs-Ivanchenko is collecting clothes and other goods to be sent to the Polish and Romanian borders, where many women and children are taking shelter after the men were ordered to stay and fight. Enschede-based charity Twente voor Oekraine is taking donations and items including sleeping bags, mattresses, phone chargers and power banks to set up temporary shelters for refugees waiting to cross the border. Organiser Taco Potze, whose software firm Open Social employs 15 Ukrainian programmers, said he had had offers of support from several local businesses as well as football club FC Twente and the university. ‘The stories of these people and the images of their country on the news didn’t leave me unmoved,’ he told Tubantia. ‘I had to do something, I couldn’t ignore such a human tragedy.’</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>February 16, 2022</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/02/a-silent-disaster-took-place-in-nursing-homes-when-covid-19-hit-ovv/</td>\n","      <td>A ‘silent disaster’ took place in nursing homes when Covid-19 hit: OVV</td>\n","      <td>The Netherlands was not sufficiently prepared for a major infectious disease outbreak when the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Dutch safety board OVV said on Wednesday, in the first of three reports on the crisis. The subsequent focus on ‘combating an infectious disease’ meant that other interests – nursing homes, education, cultural institutions, and small and medium-sized businesses – were not taken into account when drawing up policy, the OVV said, in its 300 page publication. ‘The Covid-19 crisis touched people’s lives throughout the world. Here, the health crisis spilled over into the biggest social crisis we have seen in decades,’ OVV chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said. The first coronavirus case in the Netherlands was confirmed on February 27 and at that moment, there was a lack of expertise at a national level in dealing with an epidemic, which led to a lot of improvisation, the report said. In particular, the situation in nursing homes and in the community nursing sector were largely ignored, and this led to a ‘silent disaster’, the OVV said. Almost half the official coronavirus deaths in 2020 were among residential care residents. Warnings about the critical situation in nursing homes were often not heeded because the cabinet’s focus was on hospitals and intensive care ward capacity. Masks This meant, for example, that protective clothing such as face masks, was only available for hospitals and acute care services in the early stages, exposing nursing home residents and staff to considerable risk. ‘When the gravity of the situation in nursing homes became clear, the government issued a ban on visits at the request of the nursing home sector,’ the OVV said. ‘The social and psychological impact of this measure was keenly felt, leading to loneliness and in some cases denying family members the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones who lost their lives.’ The report also criticises the fragmented nature of the Dutch health service, which complicated communication and the way government experts appeared on television and interviews. ‘It was not always clear to outsiders whether the experts were responding in their talk show performance as members of the OMT, as independent consultants with specific expertise or as representatives of their own sectoral or professional association,’ the report said. ‘The fact that the chairman of the OMT (Jaap van Dissel) emphasised the political nature of the choice to make the wearing of face masks compulsory in public transport (in May 2020) and in public areas (in August 2020) while he himself openly expressed doubts as to the value of the measure, in no way helped maintain support for the announced measures.’  ‘As a result of these statements, government policy was effectively undermined by advisors to the same government.’ Tremendous efforts The report concludes that the pandemic was – and still is – a crisis of unprecedentedscale. ‘The tremendous efforts of many, which for those involved in the heart of the crisis organisation still continues to this day, has not been able to prevent the crisis eventually affecting everyone. People were not only hit by the crisis itself, but also by the implemented measures.’ In the future, officials should be ‘acutely aware of the needs of vulnerable groups and monitor the approach to make sure that it is working for them,’ the board said. There should also be a clear separation between the role of the advisors (the experts) and the role of the decision makers (the government officials). The report focuses on the period March to September 2020. The second report, which covers the period September 2020 to July 2021, will be published in the summer.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>468</th>\n","      <td>November 27, 2019</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2019/11/wadden-container-disaster-a-quarter-of-the-cargo-is-still-at-sea/</td>\n","      <td>Wadden container disaster – a quarter of the cargo is still at sea</td>\n","      <td>Some 800 tonnes of freight which fell overboard from a container ship in the Wadden Sea during bad weather in January has still not been recovered, infrastructure minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen has told MPs. The MSC Zoe lost 342 containers of goods, leading to a massive clean-up operation as plastic, toys and machinery were washed up on the shores of the Wadden Islands. In total, 299 containers have been salvaged at a cost of €35m so far, with the ship’s owner picking up the bill. The minister said  further efforts to use boats and divers to recover the goods would be pointless because the items have been spread over such a large area. Each search costs 2.5 litres of diesel for every kilo of recovered waste, the minister said in her briefing. The MSC Zoe is one of the biggest freighters in the world and can carry 19,000 containers in total. It was heading from Portugal to Bremerhaven in Germany when the containers came loose in high seas. The beach clean-up operation will last until mid 2020 and beyond if necessary, the minister said. The coastline of the Wadden island of Schiermonnikoog, for example, remains polluted with plastic beading, and new waste continues to wash up every day.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>469</th>\n","      <td>October 2, 2019</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2019/10/dutch-government-urged-to-look-at-role-of-ukraine-in-mh17-disaster/</td>\n","      <td>Dutch government urged to look at role of Ukraine in MH17 disaster</td>\n","      <td>Dutch MPs have urged foreign minister Stef Blok to look again at the role of Ukraine in the MH17 plane disaster, particularly at why Ukrainian air space had not been closed. During a debate on the tragedy, in which 298 people died, MPs called on Blok to find out why the Malaysia Airlines plane was able to fly over Ukraine even though there was serious fighting in the east. The Dutch safety board said in 2015 there had been enough reason to close airspace. The plane, carrying mainly Dutch nationals, was brought down by a Russian made Buk missile over eastern Ukraine in July 2014. According to the Parool, the government has been reluctant to ask Ukraine difficult questions because it is an ally and closely involved in the investigation into what happened. Unlike Russia, Ukraine is not being held partly responsible for the disaster. But the close relationship between Ukraine and the Netherlands has been soured since Kiev returned a possible witness to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange scheme.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>470</th>\n","      <td>May 28, 2019</td>\n","      <td>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2019/05/socialist-party-chairman-to-stand-down-after-election-disasters/</td>\n","      <td>Socialist Party chairman to stand down after election disasters</td>\n","      <td>The chairman of the Dutch Socialist Party has said he will stand down when his current term of office expires at the end of this year.

Many people have a virtual hundreds of thousands of euros in equity tied up in their property because of rising prices, but that does not usually count towards a new mortgage, the paper said. Rather, mortgages are based on income and, for older people, future pension payments. A survey for ING by Kantar TNS found half of people in their 50s don’t see the need to save up and pay off the principal debt. Around half of them have not saved up any money to pay off their mortgage, the AD said. The Dutch central bank said earlier it estimated 200,000 people in their 50s could find themselves in financial trouble because of their interest-only mortgages, which enabled them to keep their monthly outgoings low. ‘Most home owners feel comfortable in their homes because they have built up a substantial increase in equity,’ ING mortgage expert Wim Flikweert said in the bank’s latest housing market briefing. ‘They’ve lived in their homes for a long time and their mortgage is relatively low. But it really is important that they have sufficient income at the point when their mortgage has to be extended.’</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>473 rows × 4 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-45ee1592-955f-40a4-91f3-57c4dd20bbef')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-45ee1592-955f-40a4-91f3-57c4dd20bbef button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

strengthen policy implementation efficiency to realize the country's annual economic and social development goals.Lan made the remark during an interview with the Xinhua News Agency during the weekend, stating that the ministry has taken actions, including a reduction in businesses' burdens, to stabilize market confidence, expand domestic consumption, attract investment, foster more innovation-driven positive forces to bolster economic growth and secure people's livelihoods.\"The ministry will accelerate issuance of the planned new treasury bonds, enhance supervision of related policy implementation, and help prevent and resolve financial sector risks,\" said Lan.In the first eight months, reductions in taxes and fees levied on businesses surpassed 1.15 trillion yuan ($157.55 billion), significantly lessening the burden on all types of enterprises.Lan pledged to continue to support small firms and micro businesses, manufacturing enterprises and high-tech sector development, and try to expand domestic consumption and secure foreign trade.The central government announced on October 24 plans to issue an additional 1 trillion yuan in treasury notes during the fourth quarter this year, as part of the effort to support post-disaster infrastructure reconstruction and improve the country's overall resilience to natural disasters.Lan said that the finance ministry will make full use of new treasury bond issuance, endorse a special assessment mechanism to accelerate supervision.China's gross budget revenues in the first three quarters stood at 16.67 trillion yuan, up 8.9 percent year-on-year, and expenditure reached 19.79 trillion yuan, up 3.9 percent, said Lan.The steady recovery of the economy has shored up financial revenue, laying a solid foundation to meet the annual budget goal, said the minister.Global Times   \n","1

Photo: XinhuaThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is exacerbating. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made four visits to Israel since October 7, but what he talked about was the US support for Israel instead of a ceasefire.With each day that a ceasefire is delayed, Palestinians' animosity toward Israel deepens. It will definitely create a longer-term and more devastating disaster in the region already plagued by decades of war.When the conflict between Palestine and Israel first broke out, China immediately expressed its stance, emphasizing that the top priority is to prevent a broader humanitarian disaster and that the fundamental way out is to implement the \"two-state solution.\" On many occasions since then, China has repeatedly stressed the importance and urgency of returning to the \"two-state solution.\"However, the US and European countries have not actively responded to this call of conscience. Instead, they have been constrained by domestic politics and wavered, preventing major countries from reaching an immediate consensus.It was not until Israel's military operations in Gaza had caused tens of thousands of casualties, including scores of women and children, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people that leaders in the US and European countries seemed to realize the need to return to the two-state solution. US President Joe Biden and some European leaders have expressed their stance on this recently.Although the current suffering in the Middle East is not directly caused by the US and Europe, as countries deeply involved in the geopolitical game there since World War II, they bear a heavy responsibility for the resumption of the war.It is precisely because of the US' unlimited support for Israel and the cowardice of the US and Europe that led to the failure to take action to maintain peace. Israel marched into Gaza without any scruples, carrying US-made weapons and equipment.So far, the US has not called for shifting the focus to a ceasefire. Instead, it supported Israel's retaliatory strikes against Gaza and enhanced the deployment of force to restrain the involvement of other forces in the Middle East.What is shocking is that some senior US officials are still questioning the Palestinian death toll; some US media outlets said that China's proposal of the two-state solution is an \"empty slogan\"; some US scholars have even publicly declared that the two-state solution is dead.On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 181 calling for the establishment of an Arab state and a Jewish state.After the 1967 War, Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which was equivalent to taking all the land assigned to Palestine by the United Nations as its own.Since the 1990s, the two-state solution has become the national policy of the US government in promoting Israel-Palestine peace talks. It has also become the official position of most countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel on the Israel-Palestine issue.The reason why the two-state solution had its ups and downs and could not be truly implemented has a lot to do with the different interests of all parties involved. An article in the Foreign Policy magazine on October 19 stated that little more than lip service has been paid to this goal by the US, and with each passing crisis, Washington grows more and more aligned with Israel.Although the future arrangement of the two-state solution still requires arduous negotiations, establishing two countries and ensuring that each one can operate stably and live in peace is the only goal that can promote negotiations between the two parties. The international community cannot give up on this goal, especially at a time when the war is rekindling.The challenge now is whether the international community can reach a consensus on this and form the basis for a ceasefire by prompting the two sides to restart negotiations. As for the modification and adjustment of the two-state solution, that is a matter for negotiation in the next step.As it stands, there is no solution to the crisis in Gaza, except the two-state solution. Any attempt to oppose or delay this plan for whatever reason will delay peace, perpetuate hatred and add fuel to the fire.If the Biden administration is still wavering on this issue and cannot make a decision, what awaits the US is likely a disaster.   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Fueling tension. Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThe latest round of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for over 20 days. While the bombardment is continuing, the crisis seems set to spill over into neighboring countries and probably the whole Middle East region. At a time when the majority of the international community is condemning the violence against civilians, the behavior of the US seems quite peculiar. Instead of calling for an immediate ceasefire, it is not only sending more munitions to this land under fire, but also standing in the way toward a complete and fundamental solution to a problem that has been dragging on for decades. As in most cases, when Uncle Sam shouts out \"The US is coming to rescue!\" things are usually getting worse, and a fair and equitable path forward is out of the question.On the second day after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, the White House immediately approved military aid to its ally and dispatched the first batch of military equipment the day after Israel began its revenge. Two USS carrier strike groups were quickly assembled in the eastern Mediterranean to strengthen military deterrence. A fortnight after the outbreak of the conflict, the Biden administration proposed to the Congress for military aid to Israel worth $14.3 billion.With the ammunition provided by Uncle Sam, Israel was able to carry out days of airstrikes all across the Gaza Strip and a possible massive ground operation. With the \"ironclad\" support from the US, the Israeli Defense Forces has the guts to set fire indiscriminately to residential buildings and public facilities, including hospitals, costing thousands of lives, most of whom are elders, women and children, the most vulnerable of society.Under the grandiose excuse of the so-called commitments to its close allies, what Uncle Sam has done with his partners has no difference from mafia gangs, i.e. to kill, to set fire, to violate the basic human conscience.When those US politicians condemned Hamas' acts and screamed \"Finish them!\" they should have known that excessive defense could also constitute a crime and there is never any justification for disproportionate acts of revenge, let alone that these acts could cause humanitarian disaster, like the siege of Gaza.Seeing from the lens of \"double standard,\" the US always enjoys its supremacy over other nations and peoples. Uncle Sam and his friends use their supremacy to run roughshod over international law. There is no need for Israeli self-defense to meet the conditions of necessity and proportionality, nor any need to comply with international humanitarian law. In their own opinion, the bombardment causing large casualties in Gaza never constitutes a war crime. Nor does the Gaza siege, the displacement of such a large number of civilians, and the reckless use of white phosphorus munitions against the unarmed people of Gaza constitute crimes against humanity. They mustn't forget that the Palestinian people, whose homeland has been under Israeli occupation for a long time, have every reason and right to live in equal peace. This is exactly the \"despicable form\" unfolding before the world right now.When the majority of the world is about to act collectively and stop the calamity that is completely out of line with modern society, it is Uncle Sam, once again, who stepped out of rank and voted against two UN Security Council resolutions calling for a temporary ceasefire between Palestine and Israel. Both resolutions asked for the respect of the human rights of the people in Gaza and both were dismissed by the country which always claims to care about \"human rights status\" around the globe.For the US, the region of the Middle East is always a leverage for its own geopolitical interests and a good market for its arms dealers. In a nutshell, when Uncle Sam comes to the rescue, it is his own interests rather than the lives of local people that he really wants to save. For the sake of the former, he can't be too ready to sacrifice the latter.The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News, Global Times, China Daily, CGTN, etc. He can be reached at Xinping604@gmail.com.   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations and the incumbent president of the UN Security Council, speaks at a press briefing on November 1, 2023 in UN headquarters, where he said a Gaza cease-fire was a \"top priority\" for the UN Security Council in November when China assumes the rotating presidency. Photo: VCGChina has assumed the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council for November and sees promoting a cease-fire in the Israel-Palestine conflict as a \"top priority,\" said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, as the number of dead has passed 10,000 for both sides since October 7, with 9,000 in the Gaza Strip.\"It is imperative to promote a cease-fire and halt the fighting, prevent further civilian casualties, prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster and prevent the conflict from spilling over,\" Ambassador Zhang Jun said during a news briefing on the work of China's presidency of the UN Security Council on Wednesday local time.The latest Israel-Palestine war has quickly become the deadliest and most destructive of the five wars fought since Hamas controlled the Gaza Strip in 2007, the AP reported. Since this conflict began, nearly 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,400 in Israel.With Israel's ground operations continuing and the conflict further intensifying, the death toll will keep rising.Chinese analysts said that due to the different stances held by the US and other members of the UN Security Council on a cease-fire, it is very difficult to see a breakthrough in adopting UN resolutions, as the US will keep using its veto power to defend Israel's \"right of self-defense,\" which means Israeli military forces will continue their bombardments and attacks against Gaza.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the president of the UN Security Council has the duty to speak on behalf of the Security Council when the members reach consensus, and host formal and informal meetings of the council.It seems symbolic but it can also play a constructive role, for instance, \"agenda setting,\" Wang said.China will work with other members of the Security Council to keep promoting peace and negotiation, and will make efforts to build humanitarian corridors to link Gaza and the outside world.Meaningful effortsResponding to a question about how hopeful he was in being able to break the present deadlock among Security Council members and adopt a text on the situation in Gaza, Zhang said: \"That's a question we are all asking ourselves, and that I am asking my colleagues. It's not just our moral duty, it's our legal duty.\"However, any text that is adopted must be important as well as meaningful, and it must send a strong message to the relevant parties about a cease-fire and abiding by international law, Zhang said. While this message did not pose a problem to many council members, it did to certain ones. However, faced with the calls of civilians, children and mothers in Gaza, the Chinese delegation would not give up, the ambassador said.The Chinese delegation will continue to work toward calling for a cease-fire, ensuring the protection of civilians, and preventing a further deterioration of tensions, as well as a humanitarian catastrophe, Zhang said, and China would focus on \"meaningful action\" along the lines of the General Assembly resolution.In the October 27 resolution Zhang referred to, the US, Israel and 12 other countries voted against it, while 121, including China, Russia, France and most UN members, voted in favor and 44 abstained. The text of the resolution sent a clear message on a cease-fire, protection of civilians and the provision of humanitarian assistance.The US has used Israel's \"right of self-defense\" as a pretext to veto the draft resolution for a cease-fire in the UN Security Council. Ma Xiaolin, senior professor and dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday that any resolution to be passed in the future should have clear restrictions to prevent Israel from abusing its \"right of self-defense,\" when many people killed in Gaza were innocent civilians like women and children.Analysts explained that Israel's mind-set is that seeking revenge and eliminating Hamas are much more important than preventing civilian casualties, and civilian deaths in Gaza should be blamed on Hamas and not Israel, because when Israel invokes its \"right of self-defense,\" it's hard to avoid \"collateral damage.\"However, the majority of the international community thinks differently, because it has nothing to do with \"self-defense\" when Israeli forces avenge the deaths of 1,400 Israelis with the lives of 9,000 Palestinians, most of whom innocent civilians.Only when the US, a permanent member in the Security Council with veto power, changes its mind and starts to act like a responsible country can the UN Security Council conclude with a binding resolution that can effectively bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, said experts.The Security Council in November will also consider issues including Syria, Yemen and Bosnia and Herzegovina; take action on the UN Assistance Mission in the Sudan, the UN Mission in the Central African Republic, and the extension of the authorization of sanctions measures for Somalia; and hold its annual regular dialogue with the commissioner of Peacekeeping Police, according to Zhang at the news briefing.The presidency of the Security Council rotates among the 15 member states of the council monthly. China last held the rotating presidency in August 2022.   \n","4     People walk through a gate to enter the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in the southern Gaza Strip on November 1, 2023. Scores of foreign passport holders trapped in Gaza started leaving the war-torn Palestinian territory on November 1 when the Rafah crossing to Egypt was opened up for the first time since October 7. Photo: VCGThe international pressure to push Israel to stop collective punishment in the Gaza Strip has been mounting with the death toll of this round of conflict surpassing 10,000. Following Bolivia's decision to suspend ties with Israel, analysts said other nations would move to apply diplomatic pressure on Israel and the US to allow a truce.At a news conference on Tuesday, Bolivia's deputy foreign minister Freddy Mamani Machaca stated that his nation \"decided to break diplomatic relations with the Israeli state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip.\" According to media reports, two other South American countries, Colombia and Chile, have recalled their ambassadors from Israel.Jordan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Israel in protest of Jerusalem's conduct in the war against Hamas, the foreign ministry in Amman announced, media reported. Bolivia was one of the first nations to sever diplomatic ties with Israel in response to the latter's military activities in Gaza. Together with Chile and Colombia, their actions aim to express discontent to Israel's collective punishment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and show solidarity and support for the Palestinian people, Tian Wenlin, a professor at School of International Studies of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In 2009, under the government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia also cut ties with Israel in protest against Israel's actions in Gaza. In 2020, the government of right-wing interim President Jeanine Anez reestablished the ties. Bolivia, Chile and Colombia all have leftist governments.On Wednesday, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lior Haiat said in a post on X that Bolivia is aligning itself with Hamas.Many of the leftist governments and leaders in the area have chosen to support the underprivileged and base their diplomatic decisions on justice. Moreover, as the Global South has grown and the West declines, more countries from the Global South are gaining strategic autonomy and fighting to protect international law's legitimacy and fairness, said Tian.Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia have all brought up the important topic of international law in relation to the current state of affairs in Gaza. For example, Chile Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it decided to recall its ambassador \"in the face of the unacceptable violations of international humanitarian law committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip.\"Although these are drastic measures to express disapproval of Israel's activities, severing ties and withdrawing diplomats are not uncommon in the Middle East. Also, nations whose relations with Israel are frozen may decide to do the same, said Tian.In addition, Arab nations with diplomatic ties to Israel would come under increased pressure if the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsened. It's also possible that some of these nations may sever ties with Israel in order to placate domestic public sentiment, said the expert.For Arab nations that maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, deciding whether to sever ties can be more difficult because normalizing relations required a lot of work and they must also take the US into account. However, it is obvious that future negotiations between Israel and other Arab nations on normalization will be more challenging, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times.Before Hamas' sudden attack at Israel on October 7, Saudi Arabia and Israel were on a US-brokered negotiation on normalization of relations. However, Saudi Arabia decided to pause the negotiation and informed US officials, AFP reported on October 14.Growing call for ceasefireAs of press time on Wednesday, the death toll from both Gaza and Israel has surpassed 10,000 in this round of conflict. According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, 8,525 have died and among them, 3,542 were children and 2,187 women, while 21,543 other people were injured.Israel continued its ground operation in Gaza. On Tuesday, an Israeli air strike is reported to have killed 50 people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to the Gaza-based health ministry. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.On Tuesday, the Arab world condemned Israeli airstrikes on the refugee camp. In a Foreign Ministry statement, the United Arab Emirates condemned \"the severity of the bombing carried out by Israel on the Jabalia camp in the Gaza Strip, stressing that \"the continuation of the senseless bombing will lead the region to repercussions that are difficult to remedy.\"Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that China is shocked with the great casualties of civilians in the airstrike and strongly condemns such action.China urges all parties concerned, especially the Israeli side, to maintain maximum calm and restraint, effectively implement the UN General Assembly resolution adopted on October 27, immediately cease fire, fully protect civilians, open up corridors for humanitarian assistance as soon as possible, and avoid an even worse humanitarian disaster, Wang said.Wang emphasized that China will continue to play an active and constructive role in promoting ceasefire, ensuring the safety of civilians, and pushing for an early comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question within the United Nations Security Council.While China and the international community are intensifying efforts in pushing for a ceasefire, the US continues its one-sided support to Israel. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Monday that the US does not believe that a ceasefire \"is the right answer right now.\"The US has been feeling greater stress from the international community as criticism of the Biden administration on the issue has grown, said Li.There have been growing protests against US' one-sided backing of Israel in recent days. On Tuesday, demonstrators covered in fake blood disrupted US Secretary Antony Blinken's hearing on Israel in order to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and demand that the US halt \"supporting genocide,\" causing disruption in the US Congress, according to media reports.Israel may continue its operations in the Gaza Strip with the aim of destroying Hamas, but it will encounter additional challenges, including the moral weight of mounting international criticism and the challenges of conducting ground operations in Gaza. Israel may decide to cease if the ground operation has not gone well and resulted in significant losses, but it won't stop for now, said TianAccording to some observers, ongoing military operations in Gaza would only worsen the humanitarian issue and harm Israel's reputation internationally. More humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is poised to occur as the US takes little action to halt it.The US, the EU and the rest of the international community are deeply divided on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The world is also made aware of the US and the West's double standards and hypocrisy by the stark contrast between their actions and their boasts of human rights, said Tian, noting that the US has completely lost its credibility.   \n","..

Photo:XinhuaChina has successfully developed its first holographic digital power grid in the eastern province of Jiangsu. It is expected to greatly improve the smart operations and inspections of the grid, according to the State Grid Corporation of China (State Grid).The virtual power grid has integrated technologies such as Beidou satellites, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. It has realized the three-dimensional restoration of the local power grid, which includes 100,000 kilometers of overhead transmission lines and 280,000 electric transmission towers.Unmanned drones have also been deployed to inspect the automatic transmission lines of the electric transmission towers. The drones can fulfill functions such as automatic route planning and real-time monitoring, said Jiang Haibo, deputy general manager of Jiangsu Fangtian Power Technology Co., Ltd., the project's builder.Jiang said the drones have centimeter-level high-precision positioning capabilities and an inspection efficiency about six times that of manual inspections.The digital grid can also simulate and predict the real grid operation environment under extreme conditions such as typhoons and freezing weather, providing reference for disaster-prevention solutions, said Wu Qiang, deputy director of the equipment department of State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd.The maximum load of the Jiangsu power grid is expected to hit 112 million kilowatts over the upcoming peak season. To meet the increasing electricity demand this winter, the holographic digital power grid can help shorten troubleshooting times by about 10 percent and greatly improve the safety and reliability of the power grid during peak hours, Wu said.   \n","450

more frequent and more intense, and their impacts will be dramatic, a Swedish expert said on Wednesday.\"It is worrying that we see more dramatic effects than what we believed only ten years ago,\" Mikael Karlsson, associate professor of environmental science and senior lecturer in climate change leadership at Uppsala University, told Swedish Television (SVT), commenting on the most recent heatwave that pushed temperatures above 19 degrees Celsius in Poland and the Czech Republic and close to 17 degrees Celsius in the Netherlands.Tora Tomasdottir, an SVT meteorologist, said that it was \"extremely unusual\" for so many temperature records to be broken in such a short time.Karlsson told SVT that although the most recent heatwave cannot be definitely attributed to climate change, further temperature records will very likely be broken in the years to come.\"We will no doubt be affected by extreme weather more often,\" he said.While the historic winter warm spell shattered records across Europe, North America battled freezing temperatures and heavy snow.Stopping short of attributing this to global warming, Karlsson said that the cost of climate change will likely surpass previous estimates.\"Climate change is probably the most expensive (disaster) ever caused by humankind. The cost is on par with that of a world war,\" he said.   \n","451                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         A view of Coron Island in Palawan, Philippines Photo: VCGDuring President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr of the Philippines' three-day visit to China, which concluded on Thursday, China and the Philippines signed a total of 14 cooperation documents. One of the major documents was an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with a focus on bilateral cooperation in infrastructure projects.The two countries first signed the MoU on the BRI in November 2018 and the updated version will further promote closer BRI cooperation, which will underpin the expansion of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, Chinese experts noted.In terms of broad bilateral cooperation, during the visit, the two countries also vowed cooperation in various areas ranging from energy to agriculture, where the potential for collaboration is huge. Closer economic and trade ties between the two countries also showed that attempts by external forces, particularly the US, to instigate tension by hyping issues related to the South China Sea are futile, experts added.Major projectsThe signing of the MoU provides an institutional guarantee for future cooperation between the two countries, as it elevates cooperation on specific projects to a strategic level, which will help further reduce any potential risks, Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.\"The signing of the updated MoU also shows that the two countries focus on medium and long-term cooperation,\" he said.In addition to the updated MoU, the two countries also signed documents on several major infrastructure projects, including the Framework Agreement on Priority Bridges Crossing Pasig-Marikina River and Manggahan Floodway Bridges Construction Project, according to a joint statement released on Thursday.They also discussed loan agreements that would support Philippine infrastructure development and vowed to further strengthen infrastructure cooperation with big projects such as Davao-Samal Island Bridge.Overall, infrastructure cooperation is one of the key areas for bilateral cooperation, analysts noted.Such cooperation on infrastructure is based on the strong complementarity between the two economies and their respective needs for economic development, Xu Ningning, executive president of the China-ASEAN Business Council, told the Global Times on Thursday.Key projects such as the China-built Davao-Samal Island Bridge, which has recently broken ground, will help improve the local transportation system and meet the Philippines' economic development needs, experts noted.Contracted by China Road & Bridge Corporation, a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, the bridge is a flagship project between the Chinese and Philippine governments. Once operational, the bridge will help shorten travel time between Davao and Samal Island, and revitalize the local economic and tourism activities, while facilitating the development of logistics and trade, according to experts.The construction of infrastructure like bridges offer a practical boost to regional transport connectivity and the economic development of the Philippines, which has a huge room for infrastructure construction, Liu Zongyi, secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.Chinese enterprises have actively participated in the construction of road bridges, ports, power stations, housing, water conservancy and other projects in the Philippines. So far, nearly 40 intergovernmental cooperation projects have been carried out, covering many fields such as epidemic prevention, disaster relief, road bridges, and agricultural cooperation.More potentialIn addition to the MoU on the BRI, both sides also vowed to expand cooperation in the energy sector. They agreed to resume discussions on oil and gas development at an early date and the two sides also agreed to explore cooperation in such areas as solar-power, wind energy, electric vehicles, and nuclear energy for electricity generation, according to the joint statement.Cooperation in energy is also mutually beneficial for both sides and has huge potential after years of cooperation, Xu Liping said. \"Such cooperation requires both parties to further develop ideas, and explore more mutually beneficial projects,\" he said.The two countries signed an MoU on cooperation on oil and gas development in 2018.On Thursday, the two sides also agreed to strengthen agricultural cooperation, with several corresponding documents being signed, including the Action Plan on Agriculture and Fisheries Cooperation (2023-25), the handover certificate of Sino-Philippine Center for Agricultural Technology-Technical Cooperation Program Phase III, and the Protocol Agreeing on the Phytosanitary Requirements for Philippine Fresh Durian Exports to China.Such moves underlined efforts by the two major agricultural countries to further tap new opportunities in the agricultural sector.As close neighbors separated only by a strip of water, the economic and trade cooperation between China and the Philippines has continued to deepen in recent years.China has been the largest trading partner for the Philippines for six consecutive years, while the value of new contracts signed by Chinese firms in the Philippines nearly tripled and the annual scale has exceeded $10 billion, according to the China-ASEAN Business Council.\"Facing the current unfavorable factors such as the turmoil in the international situation, the sluggish world economic growth, and the COVID-19 pandemic, China and the Philippines, which live next to each other, should further enhance cooperation and fully develop the economic and trade complementarity between the two countries,\" Xu Ningning said.In addition to bilateral cooperation, the two countries also look forward to expanding regional cooperation, with focus on increased economic and social connectivity and development, centering around trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, new modes of industrialization, digitization, low-carbon development and agricultural modernization, according to the joint statement.   \n","452                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr delivers a speech during his visit to a vaccination site in Manila on August 1, 2022.Photo: AFPAt the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, President of the Republic of the Philippines Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. began a three-day state visit to China on Tuesday. This is Marcos' first visit to China as president and his first official visit to a country outside the ASEAN. Moreover, Marcos will be the first foreign head of state to be hosted by China in 2023. It can be seen that both China and the Philippines attach great importance to bilateral relations. The so-called tension between China and the Philippines, created by Western public opinion not long ago, collapsed on itself. The hype without a factual basis eventually failed to take root.\"I will be opening a new chapter in our comprehensive strategic cooperation with China,\" Marcos said before departing for Beijing. The two countries are set to sign more than 10 key bilateral agreements. The Philippines side noted the two will establish a direct communication channel between their foreign ministries to avoid \"miscalculation and miscommunication\" in the disputed waters.This reflects two themes. First, mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between China and the Philippines will be continuously promoted, which is the locomotive and engine leading the development of bilateral relations. Second, divergences in the South China Sea will be managed and controlled, and will be prevented to become a stumbling block of pragmatic cooperation, or a fuse of a crisis that could undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea.In recent years, China and the Philippines have been meeting each other half way on these two themes, achieved fruitful results and reached leapfrog development. On the South China Sea issue, both sides made a lot of communication with good intentions, and did not let it become an obstacle to bilateral relations. In the field of economy and trade, in recent years, China's cumulative approved investments in the Philippines quadrupled. The total trade volume between the two has also doubled. China has been the Philippines' largest trading partner, largest source of imports and second largest export market. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative is in deep cooperation with the Philippines' \"Build, Build More\" and \"Build Better More\" programs. The two sides have carried out nearly 40 intergovernmental cooperation projects in fields such as epidemic prevention, disaster relief, infrastructure and agriculture. China-Philippines relations are on a new starting point as Marcos began his China visit. Both Marcos and all walks of life in the Philippines have been paying great attention and looking forward to this visit, hoping the bilateral cooperation in various fields will be promoted to a higher level, and even set the tone for the bilateral ties in the next five to six years.The US and Western public opinion are also keeping their eyes on the Marcos' visit, but obviously there is a clear difference between their focus and that of the Philippines. The West has been making noises, focusing on South China Sea disputes, which Marcos hopes to down play.They tried to find \"cracks\" in the South China Sea issue and vigorously create and amplify the discord and controversy between China and the Philippines. They always mention Marcos' visit to China and China-Philippines cooperation with a sarcastic tone. Their efforts run counter to the interests and aspirations of the Philippines, but keep pace with Washington's actions of sowing discord in the South China Sea, which requires all regional countries, especially the Philippines, to maintain high vigilance.When US Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Philippines in November last year, she deliberately traveled to Palawan, which is next to the Nansha Islands. When there was any slight sign of disturbance in the South China Sea, Washington immediately jumped out and said that the US will work with the Philippines to maintain the so-called \"rules-based international order\" and \"the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea guaranteed by international law.\"Washington's true intentions between the lines are already clearly revealed. It shows that the public opinion in the US and West and Washington's interests and positions on the South China Sea issue have fundamentally diverged from that of the Philippines and all South China Sea countries. Countries in the South China Sea, including the Philippines, have a relatively clear understanding of this. Marcos said that the Philippines adheres to independent diplomacy and will not choose sides. But for the Philippines and other countries in the region, it has always been a problem to soberly and wisely deal with the \"coercion and temptation\" from Washington.It is worth mentioning that Marcos has a positive attitude toward China-Philippines joint development of offshore oil and gas. If his visit can promote the resumption of relevant negotiations between the two countries, it will be a significant progress.In as early as 2005, China and the Philippines started discussions and negotiations on oil and gas cooperation in the South China Sea. However, due to the complicated influence of Philippine domestic politics and interference from the outside, the consultations and negotiations experienced difficulties, failed to achieve a breakthrough.Although this is somewhat regrettable, China and the Philippines have already established some consensus, which is the basis for restarting the negotiations, and the setbacks in the past also provided important experiences for both sides. The joint development of oil and gas is a crucial step in building the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation. We hope that Marcos' visit will bring new opportunities and usher in a new \"golden age\" of China-Philippines friendship.   \n","453                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Nepali Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal addresses the inauguration ceremony for Pokhara International Airport in Pokhara, Nepal, Jan. 1, 2023.

Photo: XinhuaThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is exacerbating. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made four visits to Israel since October 7, but what he talked about was the US support for Israel instead of a ceasefire.With each day that a ceasefire is delayed, Palestinians' animosity toward Israel deepens. It will definitely create a longer-term and more devastating disaster in the region already plagued by decades of war.When the conflict between Palestine and Israel first broke out, China immediately expressed its stance, emphasizing that the top priority is to prevent a broader humanitarian disaster and that the fundamental way out is to implement the \"two-state solution.\" On many occasions since then, China has repeatedly stressed the importance and urgency of returning to the \"two-state solution.\"However, the US and European countries have not actively responded to this call of conscience. Instead, they have been constrained by domestic politics and wavered, preventing major countries from reaching an immediate consensus.It was not until Israel's military operations in Gaza had caused tens of thousands of casualties, including scores of women and children, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people that leaders in the US and European countries seemed to realize the need to return to the two-state solution. US President Joe Biden and some European leaders have expressed their stance on this recently.Although the current suffering in the Middle East is not directly caused by the US and Europe, as countries deeply involved in the geopolitical game there since World War II, they bear a heavy responsibility for the resumption of the war.It is precisely because of the US' unlimited support for Israel and the cowardice of the US and Europe that led to the failure to take action to maintain peace. Israel marched into Gaza without any scruples, carrying US-made weapons and equipment.So far, the US has not called for shifting the focus to a ceasefire. Instead, it supported Israel's retaliatory strikes against Gaza and enhanced the deployment of force to restrain the involvement of other forces in the Middle East.What is shocking is that some senior US officials are still questioning the Palestinian death toll; some US media outlets said that China's proposal of the two-state solution is an \"empty slogan\"; some US scholars have even publicly declared that the two-state solution is dead.On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 181 calling for the establishment of an Arab state and a Jewish state.After the 1967 War, Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which was equivalent to taking all the land assigned to Palestine by the United Nations as its own.Since the 1990s, the two-state solution has become the national policy of the US government in promoting Israel-Palestine peace talks. It has also become the official position of most countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel on the Israel-Palestine issue.The reason why the two-state solution had its ups and downs and could not be truly implemented has a lot to do with the different interests of all parties involved. An article in the Foreign Policy magazine on October 19 stated that little more than lip service has been paid to this goal by the US, and with each passing crisis, Washington grows more and more aligned with Israel.Although the future arrangement of the two-state solution still requires arduous negotiations, establishing two countries and ensuring that each one can operate stably and live in peace is the only goal that can promote negotiations between the two parties. The international community cannot give up on this goal, especially at a time when the war is rekindling.The challenge now is whether the international community can reach a consensus on this and form the basis for a ceasefire by prompting the two sides to restart negotiations. As for the modification and adjustment of the two-state solution, that is a matter for negotiation in the next step.As it stands, there is no solution to the crisis in Gaza, except the two-state solution. Any attempt to oppose or delay this plan for whatever reason will delay peace, perpetuate hatred and add fuel to the fire.If the Biden administration is still wavering on this issue and cannot make a decision, what awaits the US is likely a disaster.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2023/11/03</td>\n","      <td>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301159.shtml</td>\n","      <td>Behold! Uncle Sam is coming to ‘rescue!’</td>\n","      <td>Fueling tension. Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThe latest round of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for over 20 days. While the bombardment is continuing, the crisis seems set to spill over into neighboring countries and probably the whole Middle East region. At a time when the majority of the international community is condemning the violence against civilians, the behavior of the US seems quite peculiar. Instead of calling for an immediate ceasefire, it is not only sending more munitions to this land under fire, but also standing in the way toward a complete and fundamental solution to a problem that has been dragging on for decades. As in most cases, when Uncle Sam shouts out \"The US is coming to rescue!\" things are usually getting worse, and a fair and equitable path forward is out of the question.On the second day after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, the White House immediately approved military aid to its ally and dispatched the first batch of military equipment the day after Israel began its revenge. Two USS carrier strike groups were quickly assembled in the eastern Mediterranean to strengthen military deterrence. A fortnight after the outbreak of the conflict, the Biden administration proposed to the Congress for military aid to Israel worth $14.3 billion.With the ammunition provided by Uncle Sam, Israel was able to carry out days of airstrikes all across the Gaza Strip and a possible massive ground operation. With the \"ironclad\" support from the US, the Israeli Defense Forces has the guts to set fire indiscriminately to residential buildings and public facilities, including hospitals, costing thousands of lives, most of whom are elders, women and children, the most vulnerable of society.Under the grandiose excuse of the so-called commitments to its close allies, what Uncle Sam has done with his partners has no difference from mafia gangs, i.e. to kill, to set fire, to violate the basic human conscience.When those US politicians condemned Hamas' acts and screamed \"Finish them!\" they should have known that excessive defense could also constitute a crime and there is never any justification for disproportionate acts of revenge, let alone that these acts could cause humanitarian disaster, like the siege of Gaza.Seeing from the lens of \"double standard,\" the US always enjoys its supremacy over other nations and peoples. Uncle Sam and his friends use their supremacy to run roughshod over international law. There is no need for Israeli self-defense to meet the conditions of necessity and proportionality, nor any need to comply with international humanitarian law. In their own opinion, the bombardment causing large casualties in Gaza never constitutes a war crime. Nor does the Gaza siege, the displacement of such a large number of civilians, and the reckless use of white phosphorus munitions against the unarmed people of Gaza constitute crimes against humanity. They mustn't forget that the Palestinian people, whose homeland has been under Israeli occupation for a long time, have every reason and right to live in equal peace. This is exactly the \"despicable form\" unfolding before the world right now.When the majority of the world is about to act collectively and stop the calamity that is completely out of line with modern society, it is Uncle Sam, once again, who stepped out of rank and voted against two UN Security Council resolutions calling for a temporary ceasefire between Palestine and Israel. Both resolutions asked for the respect of the human rights of the people in Gaza and both were dismissed by the country which always claims to care about \"human rights status\" around the globe.For the US, the region of the Middle East is always a leverage for its own geopolitical interests and a good market for its arms dealers. In a nutshell, when Uncle Sam comes to the rescue, it is his own interests rather than the lives of local people that he really wants to save. For the sake of the former, he can't be too ready to sacrifice the latter.The author is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News, Global Times, China Daily, CGTN, etc. He can be reached at Xinping604@gmail.com.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>2023/11/02</td>\n","      <td>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301118.shtml</td>\n","      <td>'Gaza cease-fire top priority' as China assumes UNSC presidency</td>\n","      <td>Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations and the incumbent president of the UN Security Council, speaks at a press briefing on November 1, 2023 in UN headquarters, where he said a Gaza cease-fire was a \"top priority\" for the UN Security Council in November when China assumes the rotating presidency. Photo: VCGChina has assumed the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council for November and sees promoting a cease-fire in the Israel-Palestine conflict as a \"top priority,\" said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, as the number of dead has passed 10,000 for both sides since October 7, with 9,000 in the Gaza Strip.\"It is imperative to promote a cease-fire and halt the fighting, prevent further civilian casualties, prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster and prevent the conflict from spilling over,\" Ambassador Zhang Jun said during a news briefing on the work of China's presidency of the UN Security Council on Wednesday local time.The latest Israel-Palestine war has quickly become the deadliest and most destructive of the five wars fought since Hamas controlled the Gaza Strip in 2007, the AP reported. Since this conflict began, nearly 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,400 in Israel.With Israel's ground operations continuing and the conflict further intensifying, the death toll will keep rising.Chinese analysts said that due to the different stances held by the US and other members of the UN Security Council on a cease-fire, it is very difficult to see a breakthrough in adopting UN resolutions, as the US will keep using its veto power to defend Israel's \"right of self-defense,\" which means Israeli military forces will continue their bombardments and attacks against Gaza.Wang Jin, an associate professor at the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northwest University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the president of the UN Security Council has the duty to speak on behalf of the Security Council when the members reach consensus, and host formal and informal meetings of the council.It seems symbolic but it can also play a constructive role, for instance, \"agenda setting,\" Wang said.China will work with other members of the Security Council to keep promoting peace and negotiation, and will make efforts to build humanitarian corridors to link Gaza and the outside world.Meaningful effortsResponding to a question about how hopeful he was in being able to break the present deadlock among Security Council members and adopt a text on the situation in Gaza, Zhang said: \"That's a question we are all asking ourselves, and that I am asking my colleagues. It's not just our moral duty, it's our legal duty.\"However, any text that is adopted must be important as well as meaningful, and it must send a strong message to the relevant parties about a cease-fire and abiding by international law, Zhang said. While this message did not pose a problem to many council members, it did to certain ones. However, faced with the calls of civilians, children and mothers in Gaza, the Chinese delegation would not give up, the ambassador said.The Chinese delegation will continue to work toward calling for a cease-fire, ensuring the protection of civilians, and preventing a further deterioration of tensions, as well as a humanitarian catastrophe, Zhang said, and China would focus on \"meaningful action\" along the lines of the General Assembly resolution.In the October 27 resolution Zhang referred to, the US, Israel and 12 other countries voted against it, while 121, including China, Russia, France and most UN members, voted in favor and 44 abstained. The text of the resolution sent a clear message on a cease-fire, protection of civilians and the provision of humanitarian assistance.The US has used Israel's \"right of self-defense\" as a pretext to veto the draft resolution for a cease-fire in the UN Security Council. Ma Xiaolin, senior professor and dean of the Institute for Studies on the Mediterranean Rim at Zhejiang International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday that any resolution to be passed in the future should have clear restrictions to prevent Israel from abusing its \"right of self-defense,\" when many people killed in Gaza were innocent civilians like women and children.Analysts explained that Israel's mind-set is that seeking revenge and eliminating Hamas are much more important than preventing civilian casualties, and civilian deaths in Gaza should be blamed on Hamas and not Israel, because when Israel invokes its \"right of self-defense,\" it's hard to avoid \"collateral damage.\"However, the majority of the international community thinks differently, because it has nothing to do with \"self-defense\" when Israeli forces avenge the deaths of 1,400 Israelis with the lives of 9,000 Palestinians, most of whom innocent civilians.Only when the US, a permanent member in the Security Council with veto power, changes its mind and starts to act like a responsible country can the UN Security Council conclude with a binding resolution that can effectively bring about a ceasefire in Gaza, said experts.The Security Council in November will also consider issues including Syria, Yemen and Bosnia and Herzegovina; take action on the UN Assistance Mission in the Sudan, the UN Mission in the Central African Republic, and the extension of the authorization of sanctions measures for Somalia; and hold its annual regular dialogue with the commissioner of Peacekeeping Police, according to Zhang at the news briefing.The presidency of the Security Council rotates among the 15 member states of the council monthly.

Photo: VCGThe international pressure to push Israel to stop collective punishment in the Gaza Strip has been mounting with the death toll of this round of conflict surpassing 10,000. Following Bolivia's decision to suspend ties with Israel, analysts said other nations would move to apply diplomatic pressure on Israel and the US to allow a truce.At a news conference on Tuesday, Bolivia's deputy foreign minister Freddy Mamani Machaca stated that his nation \"decided to break diplomatic relations with the Israeli state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip.\" According to media reports, two other South American countries, Colombia and Chile, have recalled their ambassadors from Israel.Jordan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Israel in protest of Jerusalem's conduct in the war against Hamas, the foreign ministry in Amman announced, media reported. Bolivia was one of the first nations to sever diplomatic ties with Israel in response to the latter's military activities in Gaza. Together with Chile and Colombia, their actions aim to express discontent to Israel's collective punishment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and show solidarity and support for the Palestinian people, Tian Wenlin, a professor at School of International Studies of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In 2009, under the government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia also cut ties with Israel in protest against Israel's actions in Gaza. In 2020, the government of right-wing interim President Jeanine Anez reestablished the ties. Bolivia, Chile and Colombia all have leftist governments.On Wednesday, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lior Haiat said in a post on X that Bolivia is aligning itself with Hamas.Many of the leftist governments and leaders in the area have chosen to support the underprivileged and base their diplomatic decisions on justice. Moreover, as the Global South has grown and the West declines, more countries from the Global South are gaining strategic autonomy and fighting to protect international law's legitimacy and fairness, said Tian.Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia have all brought up the important topic of international law in relation to the current state of affairs in Gaza. For example, Chile Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it decided to recall its ambassador \"in the face of the unacceptable violations of international humanitarian law committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip.\"Although these are drastic measures to express disapproval of Israel's activities, severing ties and withdrawing diplomats are not uncommon in the Middle East. Also, nations whose relations with Israel are frozen may decide to do the same, said Tian.In addition, Arab nations with diplomatic ties to Israel would come under increased pressure if the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsened. It's also possible that some of these nations may sever ties with Israel in order to placate domestic public sentiment, said the expert.For Arab nations that maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, deciding whether to sever ties can be more difficult because normalizing relations required a lot of work and they must also take the US into account. However, it is obvious that future negotiations between Israel and other Arab nations on normalization will be more challenging, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times.Before Hamas' sudden attack at Israel on October 7, Saudi Arabia and Israel were on a US-brokered negotiation on normalization of relations. However, Saudi Arabia decided to pause the negotiation and informed US officials, AFP reported on October 14.Growing call for ceasefireAs of press time on Wednesday, the death toll from both Gaza and Israel has surpassed 10,000 in this round of conflict. According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, 8,525 have died and among them, 3,542 were children and 2,187 women, while 21,543 other people were injured.Israel continued its ground operation in Gaza. On Tuesday, an Israeli air strike is reported to have killed 50 people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to the Gaza-based health ministry. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.On Tuesday, the Arab world condemned Israeli airstrikes on the refugee camp. In a Foreign Ministry statement, the United Arab Emirates condemned \"the severity of the bombing carried out by Israel on the Jabalia camp in the Gaza Strip, stressing that \"the continuation of the senseless bombing will lead the region to repercussions that are difficult to remedy.\"Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that China is shocked with the great casualties of civilians in the airstrike and strongly condemns such action.China urges all parties concerned, especially the Israeli side, to maintain maximum calm and restraint, effectively implement the UN General Assembly resolution adopted on October 27, immediately cease fire, fully protect civilians, open up corridors for humanitarian assistance as soon as possible, and avoid an even worse humanitarian disaster, Wang said.Wang emphasized that China will continue to play an active and constructive role in promoting ceasefire, ensuring the safety of civilians, and pushing for an early comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question within the United Nations Security Council.While China and the international community are intensifying efforts in pushing for a ceasefire, the US continues its one-sided support to Israel. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Monday that the US does not believe that a ceasefire \"is the right answer right now.\"The US has been feeling greater stress from the international community as criticism of the Biden administration on the issue has grown, said Li.There have been growing protests against US' one-sided backing of Israel in recent days. On Tuesday, demonstrators covered in fake blood disrupted US Secretary Antony Blinken's hearing on Israel in order to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and demand that the US halt \"supporting genocide,\" causing disruption in the US Congress, according to media reports.Israel may continue its operations in the Gaza Strip with the aim of destroying Hamas, but it will encounter additional challenges, including the moral weight of mounting international criticism and the challenges of conducting ground operations in Gaza. Israel may decide to cease if the ground operation has not gone well and resulted in significant losses, but it won't stop for now, said TianAccording to some observers, ongoing military operations in Gaza would only worsen the humanitarian issue and harm Israel's reputation internationally. More humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is poised to occur as the US takes little action to halt it.The US, the EU and the rest of the international community are deeply divided on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The world is also made aware of the US and the West's double standards and hypocrisy by the stark contrast between their actions and their boasts of human rights, said Tian, noting that the US has completely lost its credibility.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>449</th>\n","      <td>2023/01/06</td>\n","      <td>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202301/1283340.shtml</td>\n","      <td>China builds its first holographic digital power grid</td>\n","      <td>An unmanned drone with centimeter-level high-precision positioning capabilities inspects the automatic transmission lines of the electric transmission towers in east China's Jiangsu Province, Jan 4, 2023.

It is expected to greatly improve the smart operations and inspections of the grid, according to the State Grid Corporation of China (State Grid).The virtual power grid has integrated technologies such as Beidou satellites, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. It has realized the three-dimensional restoration of the local power grid, which includes 100,000 kilometers of overhead transmission lines and 280,000 electric transmission towers.Unmanned drones have also been deployed to inspect the automatic transmission lines of the electric transmission towers. The drones can fulfill functions such as automatic route planning and real-time monitoring, said Jiang Haibo, deputy general manager of Jiangsu Fangtian Power Technology Co., Ltd., the project's builder.Jiang said the drones have centimeter-level high-precision positioning capabilities and an inspection efficiency about six times that of manual inspections.The digital grid can also simulate and predict the real grid operation environment under extreme conditions such as typhoons and freezing weather, providing reference for disaster-prevention solutions, said Wu Qiang, deputy director of the equipment department of State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd.The maximum load of the Jiangsu power grid is expected to hit 112 million kilowatts over the upcoming peak season. To meet the increasing electricity demand this winter, the holographic digital power grid can help shorten troubleshooting times by about 10 percent and greatly improve the safety and reliability of the power grid during peak hours, Wu said.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>450</th>\n","      <td>2023/01/05</td>\n","      <td>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202301/1283230.shtml</td>\n","      <td>Heatwaves set to become more common: Swedish expert</td>\n","      <td>A woman refreshes herself with the water from a fountain at Piazza del Popolo in Rome, Italy on Aug. 5, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua)\\rA man holding an umbrella walks in front of the Louvre Museum amid a heatwave in Paris, France, July 13, 2022.(Photo: Xinhua)\\r\\rPeople enjoy the warm weather along the seaside in Nice, southern France, Jan. 3, 2023.(Photo: Xinhua)Heatwaves such as those that enveloped Europe in recent years are bound to become more frequent and more intense, and their impacts will be dramatic, a Swedish expert said on Wednesday.\"It is worrying that we see more dramatic effects than what we believed only ten years ago,\" Mikael Karlsson, associate professor of environmental science and senior lecturer in climate change leadership at Uppsala University, told Swedish Television (SVT), commenting on the most recent heatwave that pushed temperatures above 19 degrees Celsius in Poland and the Czech Republic and close to 17 degrees Celsius in the Netherlands.Tora Tomasdottir, an SVT meteorologist, said that it was \"extremely unusual\" for so many temperature records to be broken in such a short time.Karlsson told SVT that although the most recent heatwave cannot be definitely attributed to climate change, further temperature records will very likely be broken in the years to come.\"We will no doubt be affected by extreme weather more often,\" he said.While the historic winter warm spell shattered records across Europe, North America battled freezing temperatures and heavy snow.Stopping short of attributing this to global warming, Karlsson said that the cost of climate change will likely surpass previous estimates.\"Climate change is probably the most expensive (disaster) ever caused by humankind.

One of the major documents was an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with a focus on bilateral cooperation in infrastructure projects.The two countries first signed the MoU on the BRI in November 2018 and the updated version will further promote closer BRI cooperation, which will underpin the expansion of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, Chinese experts noted.In terms of broad bilateral cooperation, during the visit, the two countries also vowed cooperation in various areas ranging from energy to agriculture, where the potential for collaboration is huge. Closer economic and trade ties between the two countries also showed that attempts by external forces, particularly the US, to instigate tension by hyping issues related to the South China Sea are futile, experts added.Major projectsThe signing of the MoU provides an institutional guarantee for future cooperation between the two countries, as it elevates cooperation on specific projects to a strategic level, which will help further reduce any potential risks, Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.\"The signing of the updated MoU also shows that the two countries focus on medium and long-term cooperation,\" he said.In addition to the updated MoU, the two countries also signed documents on several major infrastructure projects, including the Framework Agreement on Priority Bridges Crossing Pasig-Marikina River and Manggahan Floodway Bridges Construction Project, according to a joint statement released on Thursday.They also discussed loan agreements that would support Philippine infrastructure development and vowed to further strengthen infrastructure cooperation with big projects such as Davao-Samal Island Bridge.Overall, infrastructure cooperation is one of the key areas for bilateral cooperation, analysts noted.Such cooperation on infrastructure is based on the strong complementarity between the two economies and their respective needs for economic development, Xu Ningning, executive president of the China-ASEAN Business Council, told the Global Times on Thursday.Key projects such as the China-built Davao-Samal Island Bridge, which has recently broken ground, will help improve the local transportation system and meet the Philippines' economic development needs, experts noted.Contracted by China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation, a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, the bridge is a flagship project between the Chinese and Philippine governments. Once operational, the bridge will help shorten travel time between Davao and Samal Island, and revitalize the local economic and tourism activities, while facilitating the development of logistics and trade, according to experts.The construction of infrastructure like bridges offer a practical boost to regional transport connectivity and the economic development of the Philippines, which has a huge room for infrastructure construction, Liu Zongyi, secretary-general of the Research Center for China-South Asia Cooperation at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.Chinese enterprises have actively participated in the construction of road bridges, ports, power stations, housing, water conservancy and other projects in the Philippines. So far, nearly 40 intergovernmental cooperation projects have been carried out, covering many fields such as epidemic prevention, disaster relief, road bridges, and agricultural cooperation.More potentialIn addition to the MoU on the BRI, both sides also vowed to expand cooperation in the energy sector. They agreed to resume discussions on oil and gas development at an early date and the two sides also agreed to explore cooperation in such areas as solar-power, wind energy, electric vehicles, and nuclear energy for electricity generation, according to the joint statement.Cooperation in energy is also mutually beneficial for both sides and has huge potential after years of cooperation, Xu Liping said. \"Such cooperation requires both parties to further develop ideas, and explore more mutually beneficial projects,\" he said.The two countries signed an MoU on cooperation on oil and gas development in 2018.On Thursday, the two sides also agreed to strengthen agricultural cooperation, with several corresponding documents being signed, including the Action Plan on Agriculture and Fisheries Cooperation (2023-25), the handover certificate of Sino-Philippine Center for Agricultural Technology-Technical Cooperation Program Phase III, and the Protocol Agreeing on the Phytosanitary Requirements for Philippine Fresh Durian Exports to China.Such moves underlined efforts by the two major agricultural countries to further tap new opportunities in the agricultural sector.As close neighbors separated only by a strip of water, the economic and trade cooperation between China and the Philippines has continued to deepen in recent years.China has been the largest trading partner for the Philippines for six consecutive years, while the value of new contracts signed by Chinese firms in the Philippines nearly tripled and the annual scale has exceeded $10 billion, according to the China-ASEAN Business Council.\"Facing the current unfavorable factors such as the turmoil in the international situation, the sluggish world economic growth, and the COVID-19 pandemic, China and the Philippines, which live next to each other, should further enhance cooperation and fully develop the economic and trade complementarity between the two countries,\" Xu Ningning said.In addition to bilateral cooperation, the two countries also look forward to expanding regional cooperation, with focus on increased economic and social connectivity and development, centering around trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, new modes of industrialization, digitization, low-carbon development and agricultural modernization, according to the joint statement.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>452</th>\n","      <td>2023/01/04</td>\n","      <td>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202301/1283154.shtml</td>\n","      <td>Marcos’ visit makes China-Philippines ‘tension’ collapse on itself: Global Times editorial</td>\n","      <td>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr delivers a speech during his visit to a vaccination site in Manila on August 1, 2022.Photo: AFPAt the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, President of the Republic of the Philippines Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. began a three-day state visit to China on Tuesday. This is Marcos' first visit to China as president and his first official visit to a country outside the ASEAN. Moreover, Marcos will be the first foreign head of state to be hosted by China in 2023. It can be seen that both China and the Philippines attach great importance to bilateral relations. The so-called tension between China and the Philippines, created by Western public opinion not long ago, collapsed on itself. The hype without a factual basis eventually failed to take root.\"I will be opening a new chapter in our comprehensive strategic cooperation with China,\" Marcos said before departing for Beijing. The two countries are set to sign more than 10 key bilateral agreements. The Philippines side noted the two will establish a direct communication channel between their foreign ministries to avoid \"miscalculation and miscommunication\" in the disputed waters.This reflects two themes. First, mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation between China and the Philippines will be continuously promoted, which is the locomotive and engine leading the development of bilateral relations. Second, divergences in the South China Sea will be managed and controlled, and will be prevented to become a stumbling block of pragmatic cooperation, or a fuse of a crisis that could undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea.In recent years, China and the Philippines have been meeting each other half way on these two themes, achieved fruitful results and reached leapfrog development. On the South China Sea issue, both sides made a lot of communication with good intentions, and did not let it become an obstacle to bilateral relations. In the field of economy and trade, in recent years, China's cumulative approved investments in the Philippines quadrupled. The total trade volume between the two has also doubled. China has been the Philippines' largest trading partner, largest source of imports and second largest export market. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative is in deep cooperation with the Philippines' \"Build, Build More\" and \"Build Better More\" programs. The two sides have carried out nearly 40 intergovernmental cooperation projects in fields such as epidemic prevention, disaster relief, infrastructure and agriculture. China-Philippines relations are on a new starting point as Marcos began his China visit. Both Marcos and all walks of life in the Philippines have been paying great attention and looking forward to this visit, hoping the bilateral cooperation in various fields will be promoted to a higher level, and even set the tone for the bilateral ties in the next five to six years.The US and Western public opinion are also keeping their eyes on the Marcos' visit, but obviously there is a clear difference between their focus and that of the Philippines. The West has been making noises, focusing on South China Sea disputes, which Marcos hopes to down play.They tried to find \"cracks\" in the South China Sea issue and vigorously create and amplify the discord and controversy between China and the Philippines. They always mention Marcos' visit to China and China-Philippines cooperation with a sarcastic tone. Their efforts run counter to the interests and aspirations of the Philippines, but keep pace with Washington's actions of sowing discord in the South China Sea, which requires all regional countries, especially the Philippines, to maintain high vigilance.When US Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Philippines in November last year, she deliberately traveled to Palawan, which is next to the Nansha Islands. When there was any slight sign of disturbance in the South China Sea, Washington immediately jumped out and said that the US will work with the Philippines to maintain the so-called \"rules-based international order\" and \"the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea guaranteed by international law.\"Washington's true intentions between the lines are already clearly revealed. It shows that the public opinion in the US and West and Washington's interests and positions on the South China Sea issue have fundamentally diverged from that of the Philippines and all South China Sea countries. Countries in the South China Sea, including the Philippines, have a relatively clear understanding of this. Marcos said that the Philippines adheres to independent diplomacy and will not choose sides. But for the Philippines and other countries in the region, it has always been a problem to soberly and wisely deal with the \"coercion and temptation\" from Washington.It is worth mentioning that Marcos has a positive attitude toward China-Philippines joint development of offshore oil and gas. If his visit can promote the resumption of relevant negotiations between the two countries, it will be a significant progress.In as early as 2005, China and the Philippines started discussions and negotiations on oil and gas cooperation in the South China Sea. However, due to the complicated influence of Philippine domestic politics and interference from the outside, the consultations and negotiations experienced difficulties, failed to achieve a breakthrough.Although this is somewhat regrettable, China and the Philippines have already established some consensus, which is the basis for restarting the negotiations, and the setbacks in the past also provided important experiences for both sides. The joint development of oil and gas is a crucial step in building the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation. We hope that Marcos' visit will bring new opportunities and usher in a new \"golden age\" of China-Philippines friendship.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>453</th>\n","      <td>2023/01/03</td>\n","      <td>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202301/1283103.shtml</td>\n","      <td>Nepal's Pokhara Int'l Airport put into operation</td>\n","      <td>Nepali Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal addresses the inauguration ceremony for Pokhara International Airport in Pokhara, Nepal, Jan. 1, 2023.

(Photo by Hari Maharjan/Xinhua)The Pokhara airport, a 4D-standard facility, was contracted with loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (China EXIM Bank) by China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd., a company directly affiliated with China National Machinery Industry Corporation which ranks among the top 500 enterprises in the world. The construction started in July 2017.\"We also know the airport is vital for economic activities, social economic development and disaster relief,\" remarked Tao Ma, regional director of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Asia and Pacific Office.\"The successful completion of the airport project is a great achievement of close cooperation between China and Nepal,\" said Liu Shengcheng, vice president of China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd.\"It is the day of realization of a dream for the people of Pokhara,\" noted Krishna Chandra Nepali Pokharel, the outgoing chief minister of the Gandaki Province, where the new airport lies.The new airport in Pokhara, the third international airport in Nepal, was designed and built on Chinese and ICAO standards, and it is a good example of China and Nepal working together under the Belt and Road Initiative, said Wang Xin, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Nepal.Wang described the project as one that has displayed China's pursuit of quality in project construction and marked Nepal's national pride.Referring to the inauguration of the new airport, the recent border reopening between Nepal and China and the start of the survey work on the cross-border railway, Prachanda said, \"Big projects are being initiated with Chinese support.\" A Buddha Air flight is saluted with water cannon when it lands at Pokhara International Airport in Pokhara, Nepal, Jan. 1, 2023.
